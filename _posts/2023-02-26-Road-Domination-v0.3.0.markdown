In this month's update, we wanted to finally challenge you with some more neighbourhoods to play in. That's why we're bringing you 3 new desert levels.

## Travelling Between Regions

It is now possible to travel to other regions. Just drive to a travelling location and use primary action. Don't worry, you can always go back.

El Gran Desierto is a brand-new region located in the desert. Enjoy the warm sand, cacti and palms.
